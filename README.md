# Tecnical Approach
The purpose of this application is to further my understanding of JavaScript and JQuery commands.  Most of this application was built in JavaScript and appended to the HTML file using jQuery.  I chose to write each question as a JavaScript object that allowed users to select either True or False with radio inputs.  Conditionals then checked each input value selected by the user in order to determine the number of questions correct, incorrect, or unanswered.  I created the countdown timer using JavaScript timing events such as setInterval and clearInterval.
